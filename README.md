# Mission to Mars with Web Scraping

## Purpose of Project

I was asked to create a HTML for Mars related images, facts, and news. This was done through the use of web scraping from several NASA websites. Doing so allowed me to create a website that pulls in news and images through a Flask app that is activited by a "Scrape New Data" button that allows the HTML to be updated with the most up-to-date Mars news, facts, featured images, and hempisphere photes. 

Along with the initial HTML page I created I was asked to use BootStrap to customize the page.

Through BootStrap, I customized two items in HTML

### Scrape Button

I updated the button that to make it more dynamic and attention getting then the default one used during creation of the HTML. 
  1) I made the button orange to grab the attention of the user
  2) The button was also made to fit the length of the title containter as well.

### Hemisphere Photos

The Mars hemisphere photos were adjusted to fit the screen of whatever the user has to view the webpage (computer screen vs mobile device)
